# Accelerometer Data Collection App

A simple application developed to help in collecting accelerometer data for further analysis.

Functionalities
- Collect accelerometer data.
- Save acceleormeter data in csv format.
- Allows accelerometer data to save locally with delete and send function.
- Make the process of sending accelerometer data to server easier

This existing project is developed to be used for part of my capstone project. Some modification will be required for general use.

Future Modification:
- Allows user to specify the url to send the csv file (Currently only port can be specified)
- Allows user to specify the delay in the app (Currently only 4 default delay can be used)
